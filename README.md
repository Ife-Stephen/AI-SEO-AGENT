## Case Study: AI SEO & Content Generator

### The Problem

Marketing teams and small business owners often waste valuable time drafting SEO-friendly blog posts, meta descriptions, and social captions. Content creation is repetitive and inefficient — every request requires starting from scratch, leading to hours lost on routine copywriting tasks.

### The Solution

I built an **AI SEO & Content Generator** using **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, and **Streamlit**, powered by Hugging Face’s OpenAI-compatible models. The agent:

* Keeps **conversation history**, so it remembers context.
* Generates **blog outlines, titles, and meta descriptions instantly**.
* Can **call external tools** (e.g., to perform calculations) when requested.
* Provides a **clean Streamlit interface** for interactive chat.

### The Impact

The AI agent reduces what used to take **hours of manual writing** into just minutes:

* Routine SEO content is now automated.
* Marketers can quickly generate **multiple content variations**.
* Efficiency improved by an estimated **70–80%**, saving several hours per week that can be redirected to strategy and creative work.
