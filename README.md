## Case Study: AI SEO & Content Generator

### The Problem

Marketing teams and small business owners often waste valuable time drafting SEO-friendly blog posts, meta descriptions, and social captions. Content creation is repetitive and inefficient — every request requires starting from scratch, leading to hours lost on routine copywriting tasks.

### The Solution

I built an **AI SEO & Content Generator** using **LangGraph, LangChain, and Streamlit**, powered by Hugging Face’s OpenAI-compatible models. The agent:

* Keeps conversation history, so it remembers context.
* Generates blog outlines, titles, and meta descriptions instantly.
* Can even call external tools (e.g., to perform calculations) when requested.
* Provides a clean Streamlit interface for interactive chat.

### The Impact

The AI agent reduces what used to take **hours of manual writing into just minutes**.

* Routine SEO content is now automated.
* Marketers can quickly generate multiple content variations.
* Efficiency improved by an estimated **70–80%**, saving **several hours per week** that can be redirected to strategy and creative work.
